Consider that you have been hired to design and develop a library management system. For the first version of the system, you are required to store the information of all the hard copy books and the audio books in the library. For both hard copy books and audio books you must store book id, book title, book author, book price and member id of the person currently in possession of the book (if no one is currently borrowing the book then store 0 in this field). Number of pages should be stored for hard copy books only and duration of audio (in minutes) should be stored for audio books only. Besides storing this information, the name of a member and his member id should also be stored. Make Method within your class(es) in order to allow any member to borrow books.
